                <h2>Research Summary</h2>
                
                <h3>The Rise of the Gig Economy</h3>
                <p>The rise of the gig economy, supported by digital platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, Upwork, and FoodPanda, has reshaped how people earn and view work. Gig jobs are defined by independence, short-term contracts, and the freedom to choose clients or projects, offering workers flexibility and quick income.</p>

                <h3>Global and Local Earnings</h3>
                <p>Globally, freelancers average about $39 per hour, while in Pakistan many earn between PKR 40,000 and 50,000 per month, with highly skilled digital workers earning as much as $20 per hour. Delivery riders working with FoodPanda earn around PKR 35,000â€“45,000 depending on hours and expenses.</p>

                <p>These examples show that gig jobs can provide opportunities and financial gains, particularly for those with strong skills and experience. However, they also reveal instability, as income varies by platform, hours worked, and market demand.</p>

                <h3>Income Volatility Challenges</h3>
                <p>Studies in Pakistan highlight significant challenges, showing that while some workers initially earned slightly higher after switching to gig work, their average earnings eventually dropped from about $220 to $85 per month after expenses, with over 70% of educated gig workers reporting lower income than before.</p>

                <p>This lack of stability is worsened by the absence of health insurance, pensions, and legal protections, which often leads to financial stress and anxiety. As a result, gig jobs are often seen as side income rather than a reliable, long-term career path.</p>

                <h3>Permanent Employment Advantages</h3>
                <p>On the other hand, permanent employment offers greater stability, structured growth, and long-term benefits. In Pakistan, the average monthly income for a full-time worker is around PKR 80,000, while experienced employees can earn PKR 150,000 or more.</p>

                <p>Permanent roles also provide benefits such as health insurance, pensions, paid leave, and legal protections against sudden termination. These features reduce stress by ensuring consistent salaries and job security.</p>

                <h3>Worker Preferences</h3>
                <p>Globally, around 82% of workers still favour permanent jobs over freelancing or gig work, as they value predictable pay, timely salaries, and clear career advancement. This preference shows that while gig work is attractive for flexibility and autonomy, many still prefer the certainty and social protection that comes with permanent employment.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Overall, gig jobs have succeeded in creating new opportunities and meeting the demand for flexible, short-term work, but their lack of stability, consistent income, and social protection makes them less sustainable as a full-time livelihood. Permanent employment, although less flexible, remains more successful in offering long-term financial security, benefits, and career development, which explains why the majority of workers still view it as the stronger and more sustainable option.</p>
