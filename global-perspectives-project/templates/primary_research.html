                    <h2>Interview with Permanent Employees</h2>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Haris Engineering Concern PTV Ltd</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 17, 2025</p>

                <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                <p>From our interviews with permanent employees, we discovered several important insights about their preference for traditional employment over gig work:</p>

                <h3>Experience and Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>The employees we interviewed expressed that they gravitated towards permanent employment because they felt they weren't experienced enough or weren't mentally prepared to take risks at the start of their careers. They preferred working under someone to gain experience and practice their skills in a structured environment.</p>

                <h3>Work Structure and Motivation</h3>
                <p>Many shared that working under supervision built pressure that helped them work in order and motivated them to complete their work on time. This structured approach provided them with clear expectations and accountability measures that they found beneficial for their professional development.</p>

                <h3>Benefits and Security</h3>
                <p>A significant factor that attracted them to permanent employment was the comprehensive benefits package, including:</p>
                <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
                    <li>Paid leave</li>
                    <li>Health insurance</li>
                    <li>Fixed salary providing financial stability</li>
                    <li>Job security</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Financial Stability Concerns</h3>
                <p>The fixed salary aspect was particularly important to our interviewees. They expressed concerns about the unpredictable nature of gig work income, where "profit and loss is all yours." The guaranteed income from permanent employment assured them that they would be able to support themselves and their families consistently.</p>

                <h3>Cultural and Educational Factors</h3>
                <p>Interestingly, many participants mentioned that their mindset was developed from the start to pursue "proper jobs," and there wasn't much knowledge or awareness offered to them about alternative career paths like freelancing or gig work during their educational journey.</p>
